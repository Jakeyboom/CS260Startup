# AmigoOrganizado

[My Notes](notes.md)

AmigoOrganizado is a web application intended for helping college students to organize their work! By signing up and giving a little bit of information about each class that a student is taking (name of the class and difficulty) and each assignment that is due (ranked by difficulty), AmigoOrganizado will help students prioritize their work!  Some of the functionality includes a prioritizer (which assignemnts should be completed first based on class difficulty, assignment difficulty and due date), an "emergency window" which says all assignments that are due today, as well as a kind of anonymous "leaderboard" which currently states which student is having the most amount of coursework to complete

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.
